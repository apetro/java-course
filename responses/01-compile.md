## Compiling vs Running Code

The first command we entered `javac custom_order.java` will create a 'class' file, which is machine-readable code. The class file may be hidden on your text editor, since you should never directly edit this file. You can see it by typing `ls` into the terminal. When we ran the `java custom_order` command, we told the computer to read that class file. Therefore, we need to re-compile our code _each time_ we make changes that we want to run.

Open the custom_order.java file in your text editor to view the code before it is compiled. We will be editing this code to create a Java Cake & Cupcake Shop ordering system!

_You need to re-compile your code each time you want to test edits to your java file._
